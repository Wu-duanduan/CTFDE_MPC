# CTFDE_MPC
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based UAV Pathfinding for Obstacle Avoidance in Stochastic Environment

This repository contains the code for the implementation of CTPDE, CTFDE, and CTFDE-MPC for UAV obstacle avoidance in the stochastic environment. 
Our experiments are conducted in simulations and real-robot systems. The experiment video is available at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gw41197hV/?vd\_source=9de61aecdd9fb684e546d032ef7fe7bf

How to use the code: You can open each directory, the instructions for running each simulation are written in the respective readme.md. Dependencies: The code is written in Python. We recommend using Python 3.7. The required packages can be found in the file environment.yml.
